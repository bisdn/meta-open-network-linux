Upstream-Status: undecided if suitable [rather hackish, but also simple]

Subject: [PATCH] tun: allow setting hwaddr on tap interface creation

Sometimes using a fixed mac address on tap interfaces is desired, but
setting it after creation may race with e.g. a network manager trying to
set its own mac address (*cough* systemd-networkd) or configuring /
enabling the interface.

So allow passing a mac address in the ifreq by (ab)using the fact that
the sa_family field of the sockaddr matches the ifr_flags, so we can
just use the sa_data field of ifr_hwaddr for passing it.

To avoid assigning unexpected mac addresses, do a validity check before
trying to use it.
